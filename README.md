# Bootstrap-5 Isolated Integration

This repository facilitates the integration of Bootstrap-5 into your project, especially in scenarios where conflicts might arise. The process is straightforward - simply encapsulate your code within an element that has Bootstrap-5 as a class.

## Usage Example:

Let's say you have a section in your HTML that you want to style with Bootstrap-5. Here's how you can achieve this:

```html
<div class="bootstrap-5">
    <!-- Your code goes here -->
    <h1>Hello, Bootstrap-5!</h1>
    <p>This is a styled section using Bootstrap-5 classes.</p>
    <!-- Add more elements as needed -->
</div>
```

By encapsulating your code within an element with the bootstrap-5 class, you ensure that Bootstrap-5 styles are applied only to this specific section, minimizing conflicts with other styles in your project.
